Apache Installation :
Step 1. Installing apache : 
        sudo apt update
		sudo apt install apache2
		
Step 2. Adjusting the firewall:
		sudo ufw app list
		
		sudo ufw status 
		  - error : inactive (ufw not installed)
		
		sudo apt-get install ufw
		sudo ufw enable
		
		sudo ufw status 
		    output : active
		
		
Step 3. Checking your web browser:
		sudo systemctl status apache2
			error : System has not been booted with systemd as init system (PID 1). Can't operate.
                    Failed to connect to bus: Host is down

			solution : My system is using SysVinit as the init system.So, Apache service using commands like service apache2 start, service apache2 stop, and service apache2 status
			
		service apache2 start
			output	- Starting Apache httpd web server apache2  
		service apache2 status
			output -  apache2 is running
			
		hostname -I
		  output : 172.29.203.108
		  
		 
		When you have your server’s IP address, enter it into your browser’s address bar:
			http://172.29.203.108
		You should see the default Ubuntu 20.04 Apache web page.
